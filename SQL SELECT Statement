# The SQL SELECT Statement
    The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
## Here are some SQL SELECT statement tasks along with the example queries:
    1. Select All Columns from a Table
        Task: Select all columns from a table named employees.
          ### SELECT * FROM employees; ###
   
    2.Select Specific Columns
        Task: Select the first_name, last_name, and email columns from the employees table.
          ### SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM employees; ###

    3.Filtering Rows with a WHERE Clause
        Task: Select all columns from the employees table where the department is 'Sales'.
          ### SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'; ###

    4.Using AND/OR in WHERE Clause
        Task: Select the first_name, last_name, and salary columns from the employees table where the department is 'Sales' and the salary is greater than 50000.
          ### SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 50000;

    5.Ordering Results
