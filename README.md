# SQL for Data Analysis (Retail sales analysis) :
## Overview :
- We are analysing Electronic Manufacturer's sales data to identify high-performing branches and products, analyze the sales patterns of various products, and understand customer behavior. The primary objective is to enhance and optimize sales strategies. We attached all datasets into hereüëÜüèª.
### Here are some SQL Consepts are there that can help you understand and utilize the Analysis in various scenarios:
 - [SELECT statement](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20SELECT%20Statement)<br>Used to retrieve data from a database. It can be as simple as SELECT * FROM table_name to retrieve all columns and rows from a table, or more complex with conditions, aggregations, and joins.
- [WHERE clause](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20WHERE%20Clause.md)<br>Used to filter rows based on specific conditions. For example, SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value.
- [JOIN](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20JOINS.md)<br> Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
- [GROUP BY](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20GROUP%20BY%20Statements.md) <br>Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, typically used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc. For example, SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name.
- [ORDER BY](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20ORDER%20BY%20Statement.md)<br>Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. For example, SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC.
- [Aggregate functions](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20AGGREGATE%20Functions.md)<br>Functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Examples include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.
- [Subqueries](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20Subqueries.md)<br>Queries nested inside another query. They can be used to return a single value, a list of values, or a dataset for further processing.
- [Indexing](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20INDEXING.md)<br> Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table. They are created using one or more columns of a table.
- [Views](https://github.com/HameedFaizalK/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20VIEWS.md)<br>Virtual tables that are based on the result of a SELECT statement. They can simplify complex queries and provide a layer of security by limiting access to certain columns or rows.
